## For Part One Submission
Team Name: [undetermined]
Team Members: Fred Chang, Ruthie Fields, Catherine Weiss
Project Idea: [under review]

## Goals and keywords
Study the relationship between Citi Bike and subway usage during various time periods and weather conditions in New York city

- Visualize by combinining .csv output file from Java analysis program and shapefiles in GIS

Possible questions:
- Is the correlation between the systems positive or negative? (i.e. does increase in usage in one system cannibalize the usage of the other)
- How does the usage vary throughout either systems throughout the day? (focusing on AM and PM rush)
- How do seasonal changes affect usage of both systems?
- How does a breakdown in one system affect the usage of the other?
- How do major events (e.g. NYE celebration, concerts, parades, protests, etc...) affect usage pattern?
