Hey, Fred and Catherine, feel free to update this doc and push your changes!

## For Part One Submission
Team Name: Team Phoenix (from the ashes of our first idea, we rise!)

Team Members: Fred Chang, Ruthie Fields, Catherine Weiss

Project Idea: A geo-location based recommendation application

## Goals and keywords
- Use the google api to turn addresses into coordinates.
- Use those coordinates and a landmark api to determine nearby locations
- Use those same coordinates to also determine nearby bike share kiosks
- Suggest nearby points of interest and nearby bikes to take to further points of interest

## 2.0 (aka dreams/reaches/hopes!)
- Use weather to intelligently not suggest biking in the rain
- Perhaps suggest an entire itinerary of points of interest and bike kiosks, like design a whole day.


## Data sources
Google api for address to geocode: 
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start
Citi bike stations:

- http://citibike-stations.herokuapp.com/
Foursquare api for turning locations into points of interest
- https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api
Open weather api for checking current conditions
- https://openweathermap.org/api

## Breakdown of roles
- Parsing data in Java:1 api per developer
- Analyzer (methods): 1 per developer
- Visualization: part of 2.0
