Hey, Fred and Catherine, feel free to update this doc and push your changes!

## For Part One Submission
Team Name: Team Phoenix (from the ashes of our first idea, we rise!)
Team Members: Fred Chang, Ruthie Fields, Catherine Weiss
Project Idea: A geo-location based recommendation application

## Goals and keywords
-Use the google api to turn addresses into coordinates.
-Use those coordinates and a landmark api to determine nearby locations
-Use those same coordinates to also determine nearby bike share kiosks
-Suggest nearby points of interest and nearby bikes to take to further points of interest

## 2.0 (aka dreams/reaches/hopes!)
-Use weather to intelligently not suggest biking in the rain
-Perhaps suggest an entire itinerary of points of interest and bike kiosks, like design a whole day.


## Data sources
